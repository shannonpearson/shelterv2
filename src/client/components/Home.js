          about each and every one and want to ensure that they are placed in great homes where they
          can live happy, healthy lives. The East Haven Animal Shelter works within the community to
          provide protection and care to stray, injured, and abused animals. The officers respond to
          calls regarding lost, injured, and neglected animals, both wild and domestic, and are
          often the first to provide them medical care and comfort. The Shelter provides a safe and
          comfortable environment for those stray, injured, and neglected animals while the owners
          are located or a new home is found. The Staff also works with other departments within the
          community to provide education in regards to day to day encounters with wildlife. Itâ€™s is
          also the departments responsibility to investigate all calls concerning animal cruelty. It
          is the staff's goal to continue to provide these services and enhance the quality of life
          for the residents and animals within the Town of East Haven.`}
